Here's a rundown of **popular sample schemas** across major database platforms:

---

### **1. IBM DB2 + WebSphere**

* **IBM Sample Schemas (DB2)**

  * **`SAMPLE`**: Comes with DB2. A basic business scenario with employees, departments, and projects.

    * Tables: `EMPLOYEE`, `DEPARTMENT`, `PROJECT`, `WORKS_ON`, etc.
    * Use: SQL querying, joins, procedures.
  * **`CORPDATA`**: A richer corporate-style schema, often used with advanced topics like OLAP or analytics.

* **WebSphere** (IBM Application Server)

  * Not a database, but a **Java EE application server**.
  * Often paired with DB2 in enterprise environments.
  * Can host enterprise apps using JPA/Hibernate with DB2 backend.
  * Sample Apps: TradeApp (stock trading simulation).

  * **`WideWorldImporters`**: Newer, optimized for modern SQL Server features (temporal tables, JSON, etc.).

    * More relatable to retail/wholesale businesses.

* **MS Access Sample Databases**

  * **`Northwind`**: A classic small-business example: customers, orders, suppliers, employees.

    * Lightweight, great for ER modeling and Access forms/macros.
